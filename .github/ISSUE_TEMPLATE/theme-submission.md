# Theme submission

**Please make sure that you have read the [theme submission guidelines](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#adding-a-theme-to-the-list) before submitting a theme**. The guidelines provide all relevant information and requirements that **have to be fulfilled** before the submission. Please tick the relevant boxes for your theme in the checklist below:

**Link to my theme repository:** REPLACE-WITH-URL

### I made sure that...

- [ ] the repository contains a good `README.md` describing my theme
- [ ] an open source license has been added to `LICENSE.md`
- [ ] all metadata have been added to `theme.toml`
- [ ] screenshots have been added in the `images/` folder with the [required dimensions](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#media)
- [ ] in case I'm using a customized demo via the exampleSite folder that
    - [ ] `https://example.com` is set as base url in `exampleSite/config.{toml, yaml, json}` to [avoid the abuse of unused domains](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/2575)
    - [ ] I tested that my theme's demo works with the content directory of [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample/tree/master/content)
- [ ] I tested my theme against the [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/HugoBasicExample)
    - [ ] I've checked the developer tools' console in my browser for error messages
- [ ] in case my theme is using Hugo Pipes features like `toCSS` and `PostCSS` that I have committed the `/resources` directory with all generated assets, for my theme to work in the basic version of Hugo

**N.B.** By submitting a theme to the Hugo Themes Showcase you understand that **you need to maintain your theme**. You will need to keep an eye on whether your theme's demo generates on the Hugo website, whenever there is a new release. We are a very small team and we just cannot keep up opening issues in the various theme repositories to notify authors. Whenever a theme demo breaks and remains broken then at some point it will be removed from the list without prior warning. If you no longer wish to maintain a theme please let us know.

Feel free to ask questions. We're glad to help.
