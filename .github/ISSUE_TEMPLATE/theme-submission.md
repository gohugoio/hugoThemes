# Theme submission

Before submitting a theme please make sure you've read the [README.md](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#adding-a-theme-to-the-list). It describes in detail what information are needed and which requirements have to be fulfilled for the submission. The check list below can help you.

**Link to my theme repository:** REPLACE-WITH-URL

### I made sure that...

- [ ] the repository contains a good `README.md` describing my theme
- [ ] an open source license has been added to `LICENSE.md`
- [ ] all metadata have been added to `theme.toml`
- [ ] screenshots have been added in the `images/` folder with the [required dimensions](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#media)
- [ ] in case I'm using a customized demo via the exampleSite folder that
    - [ ] `https://example.com` is set as base url in `exampleSite/config.{toml, yaml, json}` to [avoid the abuse of unused domains](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/2575)
    - [ ] I tested that my theme's demo works with the content directory of [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample/tree/master/content)
- [ ] I tested my theme against the [gohugoio/HugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/HugoBasicExample)
    - [ ] I've checked the developer tools' console in my browser for error messages
- [ ] in case my theme is using Hugo Pipes features like `toCSS` and `PostCSS` that I have committed the `/resources` directory with all generated assets, for my theme to work in the basic version of Hugo

Feel free to ask questions. We're glad to help.
