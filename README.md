# Hugo themes

A collection of all themes that were created by the Hugo community. See a complete listing of all of these themes along with screenshots and demos at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Every theme in this list will automatically be added to the theme site. Theme updates aren't scheduled but usually happen at least once a week.

## Build script

For the curious,
[here’s how](buildThemeSite.sh)
this automatic adding is accomplished.

# Installation

## Installing all themes

If you would like to install all of the available Hugo themes, simply clone the entire repository from within your working directory with this command:

    git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes.git themes

## Installing a single theme

<pre><code>cd themes
git clone <em>URL_TO_THEME</em>
</code></pre>

# Adding a theme to the list

* Create your theme using <code>hugo new theme <em>THEMENAME</em></code>;
* Test your theme against https://github.com/gohugoio/HugoBasicExample;
* Add a `theme.toml` file to the root of the theme and add some metadata about the theme;
* Add a descriptive `README.md` to the root of the theme;
** Include a brief description of the theme's visual appearance;
** Provide `alt` text for any non-decorative images used;
** Ensure images use a fully-qualified URL, i.e. begin with `http://`;
* Add `/images/screenshot.png` and `/images/tn.png` ([size requirements](#media)); and,
* [Create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) with a link to the theme's GitHub repository.

If your theme doesn't fit into the `Hugo Basic Example` site, we encourage theme authors to supply a self-contained Hugo site in `/exampleSite`.

**NOTE:** The folder name here is important, as this folder will be picked up and used by the script that generates the Hugo Theme Site. It mirrors the root directory of a Hugo website and allows you to add custom content, assets and a config file with preset values.

See [Artist theme's exampleSite](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-artists-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) for a good example. And please make the site's content as neutral as possible.

Each theme needs:

1. To be added to the hugoThemes repo;
1. To have the right fields in `theme.toml`;
1. To have the right images;
1. A good README;
1. To have `https://example.com` as base url in `exampleSite/config.{toml, yaml, json}` to avoid the [abuse of unused domains](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/2575).

## theme.toml

This file contains metadata about the theme and its creator. **Only `theme.toml` is accepted, not `theme.yaml` or not `theme.json`**. The following fields are required:

```toml
name = "Theme Name"
license = "MIT"
licenselink = "Link to theme's license"
description = "Theme description"
homepage = "Website of your theme"
tags = ["blog", "company"]
features = ["some", "awesome", "features"]
min_version = 0.38

[author]
    name = "Your name"
    homepage = "Your website"

# If porting an existing theme
[original]
    author = "Name of original author"
    homepage = "His/Her website"
    repo = "Link to source code of original theme"
```

## Media

Screenshots are used as preview in the list. Make sure that they have the right dimensions:

* Thumbnail should be 900×600 in pixels
* Screenshot should be 1500×1000 in pixels
* Media must be located in:
    * <code><em>[ThemeDir]</em>/images/screenshot.png</code>
    * <code><em>[ThemeDir]</em>/images/tn.png</code>

Additional media may be provided in that same directory.

## README.md

Your theme's README file
(which should be written in Markdown and called `README.md`)
serves a double purpose.
This is because its content will appear in two places&mdash;i.e., it will appear:

1. On your theme's details page at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/); and
1. At GitHub (as usual), on your theme's regular main page.

**Note:** If you add screenshots to the README please make use of absolute file paths instead of relative ones like `/images/screenshot.png`. Relative paths work great on GitHub but they don't correspond to the directory structure of [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Therefore, browsers will not be able to display screenshots on the theme site under the given (relative) path.
